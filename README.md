# Neural Network
An implementation of a rudimentary neural network. Mostly based on the 3Blue1Brown YouTube series on neural networks. The stochastic training idea came from Nielsen's [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com). Currently, a test has been setup training the network on the MNIST handwritten digit database.
